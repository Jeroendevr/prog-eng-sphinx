## Visual Studio Code
### Theme extension
For this editor I have ported a TextMate Theme to Visual Studio Code

See [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Programming-Engineer.birds-of-paradise) and [source](https://github.com/Jeroendevr/birds-of-paradise-vscode)

Some benefits over the "old" textMate theme include :
- Color Scheme matches complete interface
- Better token definition leading to better readability. (Using more defined lexical tokens)
  - Support for Python Docstrings
- Make use of Semantic Highlighting defined within Visual Studio Code (for use of classes and decorators)

Created with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and the [Markedly](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to simply create a static website based off markdown files too provide speed and simplicity to the writer. If you want to create one yourself see this helpful [blog article](https://www.errbufferoverfl.me/posts/2020/sphinx-blog-part-one/).
