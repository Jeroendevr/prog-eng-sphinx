# Procedure

Primary and preferred way of working is as iterative as possible. Reason is to have frequent and small releases so the customer can give early and fast feedback.  

## TDD - Test Driven Development
One of my preferred methodologies is applying [Test Driven Development](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Leading to stable and testable software during the entire development process.
