# VisualBasic for Applications

## Experience
Although for most 'real' software developers. VisualBasic for applications is not the primary tool of use. However most enterprise environments do use microsoft Excel as their primary data analysis tool. Because of this I have quite some experience in developing so called Macro's to automate repeating tasks especially focused on Excel (While applications like Word or Access are also possible)
